<H2>RUSTLR: Bottom-Up Parser Generator for Rust, Version 0.3.x</H2>


<HR></P>
The ultimate goal of <b><a href="https://crates.io/crates/rustlr">Rustlr</a></b> is to <i>round up all the hoofed herbivores</i> into a
tool that's both usable and enjoys the expressive power of LR grammars and
beyond.  It's been decades since Donald Knuth proved that <i>every
deterministic context free language has an LR(1) grammar</i>.  However, such
theoretical properties never settled the dispute between LR-style parer 
generators and those based on other techniques.  One reason is that users of
LR parsing have always faced a steep learning curve.  How an LR parser works
is not as intuitive as, for example, a recursive descent parser.  To alleviate 
this problem Rustlr implements a collection of features including:
<ul>
<li> The option of automatically generating the abstract syntax datatypes 
and required semantic actions from hints given in the grammar, 
in whole or in part.  The AST types do not necessarily mirror the format
of the grammar: one can declare dependencies that allow multiple non-terminal
symbols to share a common type (see Chapters 4 and 6 of the tutorial).
<li> The option of generating recursive AST types using the "bumpalo" crate,
which enables deep pattern matching on recursive structures by replacing
smart pointers with transparent references.
<li> The possibility of using regular-expression style operators such as
*, + and ? directly inside the grammar.  This is not as easy to do as it
sounds as the additional grammar rules needed to
support them may lead to new ambiguities.
<li> The option of using a larger class of unambiguous grammars 
compared to traditional LR and LALR, based on <i>Marcus-Leermakers delayed reductions</i>. See the <a href="appendix.html">Appendix</a>.
Other experimental features include an "unexpected wildcard" symbol.

These mechanisms help to alleviate the natural problems of combining 
context free grammars with regular expressions, without shoving core
issues under the table by resorting to ad-hoc defaults.
<li> Operator precedence and associativity declarations allow the use
of more naturally readable grammars.  
<li> The ability to interactively train the parser to give better error messages.
<li> The generated parsers also have optional access to
"external state" information that would allow them to parse some non
context-free languages. 
</ul>

<p>

Rustlr defines a trait that allows the use of any lexical analyzer as long as it's
adopted to the trait.  However, rustlr also provides a general
purpose, zero-copy lexer that suffices for many examples.  A lexer specific 
to a grammar can be automatically generated from a
minimal set of declarations.
<p>
With future releases, Rustlr will also be able to generate parsers for 
languages other than Rust.  With version 0.3.7, it
can generate a parser for F#, although not all capabilities are yet
available.  F# is the .Net version of Ocaml and lacks options when it comes
to parser generation.
Rustlr will mainly target typed, functional languages that support
algebraic types and pattern matching. 

The documentation format on 
<a href="https://docs.rs/rustlr/latest/rustlr/">docs.rs</a>
is a good technical reference but does not serve as a tutorial. 
<p>
<b>This tutorial is evolving as Rustlr is being enhanced with new features.</b>
The project aims to be backwards compatible as much as possible.

<H2>  Tutorial by Examples</H2>
<p>
The tutorial is organized around a set of examples, starting
with the simplest, with each example explaining a set of more advanced
features.  All features of rustlr will
eventually be explained as you progress through the examples. It would be
helpful if the reader is familiar with some basic bottom-up
parsing concepts, such as those covered in typical compiler texts.
<p>
The chapters in <b>bold</b> listed below are complete.  The others provide additional examples and generally contain enough comments to be readable.
The latest and most advanced features of Rustlr are described in Chapter 4 and
in the Appendix.
